You’re playing the role of the sweet little old lady in this one.</p> <ol> <li> <p>You use your email address, littleoldlady@aol.com, to sign up for Bank of America, PayPal, and ArthriticKnitting.com.</p> </li> <li> <p>It’s hard to remember more than one password. Heck, it’s hard for you to remember what medication you’re supposed to take. So you’re using the same password, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ilovemygrandson</code>, for all of these websites.</p> </li> <li> <p>ArthriticKnitting.com is hacked. The attackers sell the list of email addresses and passwords to other hackers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whomever buys the list of email addresses and passwords tries to login to PayPal with your email address and password and is able to send himself some money.</p> </li> <li> <p>The attacker has found a working credential and will try to use that information on other sites, too. He finds that it also works on BankOfAmerica.com.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="managing-passwords">Managing Passwords</h2> <h3 id="unique-passwords">Unique Passwords</h3> <p>Do not use the same password across multiple websites.</p> <p>When a website is hacked a list of usernames and passwords are often sold. Hackers buy these lists to see which username and password combinations work on other websites. It’s not a big deal if your password on something like a car forum is hacked. If that’s also the password you use for online banking, then you <em>must</em> consider that account hacked as well.</p> <h3 id="random-passwords">Random Passwords</h3> <p>Use a randomly-generated combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Do not use your name or any words found in a dictionary.</p> <p>Try a random password generator, if you want help. You’ll end up with something crazy like this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">}sKj^&amp;@'&gt;H&lt;2}Qneq^mP%</code> but it’s more secure.</p> <p>Frequently used passwords are often tried when attacking an account. Hackers can attempt to automate attacks using lists of frequently used passwords and a dictionary.</p> <h3 id="keep-track">Keep Track</h3> <p>Keep track of your passwords. There are many software solutions including 1 Password, LastPass, and Dashlane. You can even use a sheet of paper, if that’s what you’d prefer.</p> <p>The best solution is the one that you’ll actually use.</p> </article> </main> <script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-7132219-2', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script> <script src="/assets/lightbox2-master/dist/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js"></script>
