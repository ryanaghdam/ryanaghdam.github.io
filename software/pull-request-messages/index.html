In the past, pull requests had been submitted completely devoid of a description field; the title was automatically generated from the branch name. After vetting, a simple comment was left by reviewers stating that it was “good to merge” (“GTM”).</p> <p>Not only was it sometimes unclear <em>why</em> each pull request was opened, but it was also difficult to tell which pull requests had been reviewed and which ones needed another set of eyes.</p> <p>In an effort to resolve some of these issues, I made a template for opening pull requests.</p> <p>The template has the following sections, most of which are used only when applicable:</p> <p><em>Description</em> – a paragraph or two that describes the changes introduced by the pull request. The prose should be be written for a product manager; it should resemble the language found in a user story. If significant code changes, such as refactoring, are made then additional paragraph(s) of text should be targeted for engineers.</p> <p><em>Acceptance Criteria</em> – a list explicitly enumerating each user-facing change. These should be specific and should <em>not</em> assume the reader infers any side-effects or behavior. The accuracy of this section reduces uncertainty during testing.</p> <p><em>Dependencies</em> – a list of pull requests or other items that are depended upon.</p> <p><em>Test Scenarios</em> – a list of step-by-step scenarios to test. This section somewhat duplicates the acceptance criteria, but can be helpful when working on edge cases.</p> <p><em>Screenshots</em> – screenshots can be helpful to product owners when reviewing stories. You can drag-and-drop images into your browser window when editing a pull request description.</p> <p><em>Reviewers</em> – use the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments">task list</a> feature to create a bulleted list of those who need to review your pull request. The status of the check boxes is displayed wherever the pull request is referenced.</p> <p>After switching to this template, we found that it was much easier to check the status of <em>all</em> open pull requests on the Pull Requests page. It also became easier to hound and shame those who needed to review open pull requests.</p> </article> </main> <script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-7132219-2', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script> <script src="/assets/lightbox2-master/dist/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js"></script>
