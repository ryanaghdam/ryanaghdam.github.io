I remembered Rocco’s Modern Life as a hilarious show about a weird wallaby who hated his job. Now, it’s more apparent that he worked as a phone sex operator. Whenever a Dixon Oriole found its way into my desk in grammar school, I was pleased.</p> <p>Now that I found others who share my odd interest in pencils, I started to slowly build up a collection. With an Amazon gift card burning a hole in my digital wallet, I browsed their collection of woodcase pencils and excitedly added a 12-pack of Dixon Orioles, for $2.</p> <p>Two days later I opened the box and freed the first pencil from its package. As I pulled it out, I remembered the shade of yellow being slightly different. Maybe colors in the late 1990’s were different. I could have sworn that the paint in the embossment was supposed to be silver – not gold. The presharpened point looked a bit lopsided, but I was distracted by the splintered wood.</p> <p>Maybe they write well. No. Erase well? Nope.</p> <p>These aren’t the Dixon Orioles I remembered, so I checked the packaging more closely.</p> <p>“Made in India”.</p> <p>Another great American-made pencil that has gone, to return only in name, disguising a low quality pencil. This is like replacing Cal “The Iron Man” Ripkin Jr. with Nomar “The Glass Man” Garciaparra.</p> </article> </main> <script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-7132219-2', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script> <script src="/assets/lightbox2-master/dist/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js"></script>
