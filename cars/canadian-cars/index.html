I only saw a few of these. Luxury-branded vehicles, most of which had plates from Ontario, were few and far between.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replacing the Nissan Versa sedan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Micra#Canada">Nissan Micra</a>. The base model with a five-speed starts under $10,000 CAD. I saw many Micras on the road in parked in driveways.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nissan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_X-Trail#Second_generation_.282007.E2.80.932013.29">X-Trail</a>, the predecessor to the Nissan Rogue. These are getting a bit on in age so there were only a few. I’d hazard a guess that most of them have rusted away in this climate.</p> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_B-Class#First_generation_.28T_245.2C_2005.E2.80.932011.29">Mercedes B Class</a>, if you ignore that the electric drive version is available in the US.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_RVR#Third_generation_.282010.E2.80.93present.29">Mitsubishi RVR</a>, which is really just an Outlander. On a related note, there are more Mitsubishis driving around out here than there are back home. I would guess that Mitsubishi does well in Canada because they offer long-term financing. If I search for current offers for Mitsubishi, they’re offering 0% APR for 72 months on an RVR.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Aveo">Pontiac Wave</a>, which I think is a Chevy Aveo.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A few other observations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>There are lots of compact and sub-compact sedans and hatchbacks (like the Toyota Corolla and Nissan Micra) and full-size pickup trucks. I didn’t see very many mid-size sedans.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dodge seems to be a more popular brand here than in Massachusetts. This contributed to my hypothesis about Mitsubishi’s popularity being related to long-term financing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Nova Scotia does not require front license plates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Speed limits on the Trans-Canada Highway vary frequently and in 10 km/h increments between 70 and 110 km/h.</p> </li> <li> <p>Google Maps has a Canadian accent in Canada. She says “roundaboooot”.</p> </li> </ul> </article> </main> <script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-7132219-2', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script> <script src="/assets/lightbox2-master/dist/js/lightbox-plus-jquery.min.js"></script>
