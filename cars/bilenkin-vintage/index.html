Bilenkin boasts that they combine 1960’s styling and elegance with modern comfort and reliability.</p> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-vintage-015-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="A conceptual sketch from Bilenkin.

It was the end of the era where cars were designed only by artists instead of artists and bureaucrats. Automotive regulations constrained artists in building what they truly wanted. They had to consider requirements for bumpers and other nonsense.</p> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-vintage-001-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Front three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage"> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/bilenkin-vintage-001-1.jpg" alt="Front three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage"/> </a> <figcaption>Front three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-vintage-004-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Rear three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage"> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/bilenkin-vintage-004-1.jpg" alt="Rear three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage"/> </a> <figcaption>Rear three quarters view of the Bilenkin Vintage</figcaption> </figure> <p>Does the Vintage capture that elegant 1960’s design? Kind of. It looks like it’s from that era, but it isn’t elegant like the stand-out cars of that era.</p> <p>That’s because it seems to have been styled by a Russian James May.</p> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-yakov.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Yakov May (left) showing off his creation to the media."> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/bilenkin-yakov.jpg" alt="Yakov May (left) showing off his creation to the media."/> </a> <figcaption>Yakov May (left) showing off his creation to the media.</figcaption> </figure> <p>The interior is garish. It’s a hodgepodge of 1960’s (and 1950’s) materials and trends stuck on top of a modern BMW. There’s a lot of burled walnut (which I like), lots of teal and cream colored accents, mother of pearl trim, crystal, and a lot of Paisley.</p> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-vintage-007-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Here's what your passengers will be looking at."> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/bilenkin-vintage-007-1.jpg" alt="Here's what your passengers will be looking at."/> </a> <figcaption>Here's what your passengers will be looking at.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/bilenkin-vintage-006-1.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="Yes, the seats are paisley."> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/bilenkin-vintage-006-1.jpg" alt="Yes, the seats are paisley."/> </a> <figcaption>Yes, the seats are paisley.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/cold-car-vintage-moscow.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="The HVAC controls aren't that bad."> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/cold-car-vintage-moscow.jpg" alt="The HVAC controls aren't that bad."/> </a> <figcaption>The HVAC controls aren't that bad.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="image"> <a href="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/111_Bilenkin-classic-cars.jpg" data-lightbox="lightbox" data-title="The gauge cluster"> <img src="http://ryanaghdam.com/assets/images/thumbnails/111_Bilenkin-classic-cars.jpg" alt="The gauge cluster"/> </a> <figcaption>The gauge cluster</figcaption> </figure> <p>The Bilenkin Vintage looks very well made.
